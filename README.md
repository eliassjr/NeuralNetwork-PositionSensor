# Smart Position Sensor System with Neural Networks

This project focuses on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to estimate the position `y` of a barrier using the output voltages (`v1` and `v2`) from two photovoltaic modules. The displacement of the barrier in the `y` direction will cause different shadow areas on the photovoltaic modules, affecting the output voltages.
